# Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM-

In this project, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world is implemented, which combines robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM provides a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
